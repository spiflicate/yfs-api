## Player Resource

### Description

The **Player** resource represents a professional athlete in the context of a fantasy **game** (sport + season).

Player data includes:
- Name (full, first, last, ASCII forms).
- Professional team and abbreviation.
- Positions and eligible positions.
- Status (e.g. `P`, `DL`).
- Bye weeks (for NFL).
- Undroppable flag.

When accessed in a **league context**, additional information such as stats, points, ownership, and ranking are also available.

### Player Keys

A player is identified by a **player key** of the form:

```text
{game_key}.p.{player_id}
```

Examples:
- `pnfl.p.5479`
- `223.p.5479`

### HTTP Operations

- Supported: `GET`

No public `POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE` methods are documented for `player` resources directly; roster and transaction APIs handle changes to which team owns a player.

### URIs

Base player URI:

```text
https://fantasysports.yahooapis.com/fantasy/v2/player/{player_key}
```

Sub‑resources:

```text
https://fantasysports.yahooapis.com/fantasy/v2/player/{player_key}/{sub_resource}
```

You can also request additional sub‑resources using `out`:

```text
/player/{player_key};out={sub_resource_1},{sub_resource_2}
```

In practice, players are frequently requested through collections scoped to a league or team, such as:

- `/league/{league_key}/players;player_keys={player_key1}`
- `/team/{team_key}/players`

### Sub-resources

The guide lists **`metadata`** as the default sub‑resource.

Common player sub‑resources include:
- `stats` – fantasy and/or real‑world statistics.
- `ownership` – ownership information in leagues.
- `percent_owned` – percent of leagues in which the player is owned.

(Exact sub‑resource set can vary by sport and environment; the official docs show `stats` explicitly.)

Note: Live player responses can include additional fields (for example, sport-specific flags or experimental attributes) that are not described in the official Yahoo Fantasy Sports API guide. This library intentionally omits those from its documented surface until they have been explored and validated using real API responses.

### Sample Responses

#### Player in league context

Example: `GET /league/223.l.431/players;player_keys=223.p.5479` (simplified)

```xml
<fantasy_content>
  <league>
    <league_key>223.l.431</league_key>
    <league_id>431</league_id>
    <name>Y! Friends and Family League</name>

        <editorial_team_abbr>NO</editorial_team_abbr>

        <position_type>O</position_type>
        <eligible_positions>
          <position>QB</position>
        </eligible_positions>
      </player>
    </players>
  </league>
</fantasy_content>
```

#### Player stats in league context

Example: `GET /league/223.l.431/players;player_keys=223.p.5479/stats` returns:
- League metadata.
- `<players>` with one `<player>`.
- Inside `<player>`:
  - Same metadata as above.
  - `<player_stats>`:
    - `coverage_type` (e.g. `season`).
    - `season` (e.g. `2009`).
    - `<stats>` list, each with `stat_id` and `value`.
  - `<player_points>`:
    - `coverage_type` and `season`.
    - `<total>` – fantasy points total according to league scoring.

Example snippet (simplified):

```xml
<player_stats>
  <coverage_type>season</coverage_type>
  <season>2009</season>
  <stats>
    <stat><stat_id>4</stat_id><value>4388</value></stat>
    <stat><stat_id>5</stat_id><value>34</value></stat>
    <!-- ... -->
  </stats>
</player_stats>
<player_points>
  <coverage_type>season</coverage_type>
  <season>2009</season>
  <total>310.17</total>
</player_points>
```

## Players Collection

### Description

The **Players** collection represents a set of players in some context. It can be qualified in the URI by:
- **Game** – generic player information not tied to a specific league.
- **League** – player information within a league, including availability, stats, and ranking.
- **Team** – players on a particular team.

Each `<player>` under `<players>` is a **Player resource**.

### HTTP Operations

- Supported: `GET`

### URIs

Patterns for players collections (relative to `/fantasy/v2`):

```text
/players/{sub_resource}
/players;player_keys={player_key1},{player_key2}/{sub_resource}
```

When nested under other resources:

- Game context:
  - `/game/{game_key}/players`
- League context:
  - `/league/{league_key}/players`
- Team context:
  - `/team/{team_key}/players`

Examples:

- `/league/223.l.431/players;player_keys=223.p.5479`
- `/league/223.l.431/players;player_keys=223.p.5479/stats`
- `/league/{league_key}/players;status=A;position=QB;sort=PTS;count=25`

`out` works similarly to other collections:

```text
/players;player_keys={k1},{k2};out=stats
```

### Filters

The **players** collection supports powerful filters (primarily in a **league context**). From the guide:

| Filter        | Description                                               | Example                                      | Notes                                                |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `position`    | Valid player positions                                   | `/players;position=QB`                       | Only in league context                               |
| `status`      | Player availability: `A` (all available), `FA` (free agents), `W` (waivers), `T` (taken), `K` (keepers) | `/players;status=A`                          | Only in league context                               |
| `search`      | Name search (partial player name)                        | `/players;search=smith`                      | Only in league context                               |
| `sort`        | Sort key: `{stat_id}`, `NAME` (last, first), `OR` (overall rank), `AR` (actual rank), `PTS` (fantasy points) | `/players;sort=60`                          | Only in league context                               |
| `sort_type`   | Sort coverage: `season`, `date` (MLB/NBA/NHL), `week` (NFL), `lastweek` (MLB/NBA/NHL), `lastmonth` | `/players;sort_type=season`                 | Only in league context                               |
| `sort_season` | Season year for sorting                                  | `/players;sort_type=season;sort_season=2010` | Only in league context                               |
| `sort_date`   | Sort date (`YYYY-MM-DD`, MLB/NBA/NHL only)               | `/players;sort_type=date;sort_date=2010-02-01` | Only in league context                              |
| `sort_week`   | Sort week (NFL only)                                     | `/players;sort_type=week;sort_week=10`       | Only in league context                               |
| `start`       | Offset index (0-based)                                   | `/players;start=25`                          | Pagination                                           |
| `count`       | Limit count (> 0)                                        | `/players;count=5`                           | Pagination                                           |

Filters can be **combined**, e.g.:

```text
/league/{league_key}/players;status=FA;position=WR;sort=PTS;sort_type=season;sort_season=2011;start=0;count=25
```
