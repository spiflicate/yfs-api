## User Resource

### Description

A **User** represents a Yahoo account in the context of Fantasy Sports.

User‑level APIs allow you to:
- Discover which **games** a user is playing.
- Discover which **leagues** they belong to in those games.
- Discover which **teams** they own.

However, the guide suggests that you should **generally use the Users collection** with `use_login=1`, rather than calling an individual `user` resource directly.

### HTTP Operations

- Supported: `GET`

### URIs

The docs discourage direct use of `/user/{guid}` and instead recommend the `users` collection with `use_login`. Conceptually, a user resource would be accessible via:

```text
/user/{guid}
```

But in practice you work with:

```text
/users;use_login=1
```

### Sub-resources

The guide lists no default sub‑resource (`N/A`), but valid sub‑resources at the user level mirror those exposed via the `users` collection, such as:
- `games`
- `leagues`
- `teams`

Note: Actual user and users-collection responses may include additional user-level fields that are not described in the official Yahoo Fantasy Sports API guide. This library does not document or depend on such fields until they have been explored and validated using real responses.

## Users Collection

### Description

The **Users** collection lets you retrieve information about one or more users. In almost all practical scenarios, you use it to access the **currently logged‑in user** via `use_login=1`.

Each `<user>` under `<users>` is a **User resource**.

### HTTP Operations

- Supported: `GET`

### URIs

Patterns relative to `/fantasy/v2`:

```text
/users;use_login=1/{sub_resource}
```

Or with expansions:

```text
/users;use_login=1;out={sub_resource_1},{sub_resource_2}
```

Example:

```text
GET /fantasy/v2/users;use_login=1/games;game_keys=nfl/teams
```

This returns, for the logged‑in user:
- A `users` collection.
- A single `user` element.
- Under that user, a `games` collection restricted to the specified game keys.
- For each game, a `teams` collection listing the teams owned by the user.

### Sub-resources

Any valid `user` sub‑resource can be used under `users`, commonly:
- `games` – games in which the user participates.
- `games/leagues` – leagues for those games.
- `games/teams` – teams for those games.

Because of the nested resource model, URIs naturally chain sub‑resources:

```text
/users;use_login=1/games
/users;use_login=1/games;game_keys=nfl/leagues
/users;use_login=1/games;game_keys=nfl/teams
```

`out` can be used to attach extra sub‑resources to these collections in a single call:

```text
/users;use_login=1/games;game_keys=nfl;out=leagues,teams
```

### Typical Usage Patterns

1. **Get all user games and leagues**

   ```text
   GET /fantasy/v2/users;use_login=1/games
   ```

   Then for each game:
   - `/games/{game_key}/leagues`

2. **Get all teams for the current user in a specific game**

   ```text
   GET /fantasy/v2/users;use_login=1/games;game_keys=nfl/teams
   ```

3. **Get all leagues and teams in a single call** using `out`:

   ```text
   GET /fantasy/v2/users;use_login=1/games;game_keys=nfl;out=leagues,teams
   ```

   The response will include, for each game, nested `leagues` and `teams` collections beneath that game.
