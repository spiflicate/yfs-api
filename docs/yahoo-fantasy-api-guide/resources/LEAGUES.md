## League Resource

### Description

A **league** represents one instance of a fantasy competition within a game. It contains:
- A set of teams (managed by one or more Yahoo users).
- Scoring and roster configuration.
- Schedules, standings, and scoreboards.
- Transaction history.

Leagues:
- Exist in the context of a **game** (NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, etc.).
- May be **public** or **private**.
- For private leagues, data is only available to authorized users (managers in the league or commissioners), subject to OAuth permissions.

### League Keys

A league is identified by a **league key** of the form:

```text
{game_key}.l.{league_id}
```

Examples:
- `pnfl.l.431`
- `223.l.431`

Notes:
- The separator between `game_key` and `league_id` is a **lowercase `l`**, not the digit `1`.

### HTTP Operations

- Supported: `GET`

There are no public `POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE` methods documented for `league` itself; write operations generally happen via `roster` or `transactions` APIs.

### URIs

Base league URI:

```text
https://fantasysports.yahooapis.com/fantasy/v2/league/{league_key}
```

Examples:
- `GET /fantasy/v2/league/223.l.431`

Sub‑resources are appended:

```text
https://fantasysports.yahooapis.com/fantasy/v2/league/{league_key}/{sub_resource}
```

Examples:
- `GET /fantasy/v2/league/223.l.431/settings`
- `GET /fantasy/v2/league/223.l.431/standings`
- `GET /fantasy/v2/league/223.l.431/scoreboard`
- `GET /fantasy/v2/league/223.l.431/teams`
- `GET /fantasy/v2/league/223.l.431/players`
- `GET /fantasy/v2/league/223.l.431/transactions`

You can also use `out` to retrieve multiple sub‑resources in a single call:

```text
/league/{league_key};out=settings,standings
```

### Sub-resources

The official guide lists **`metadata`** as the default sub‑resource. Key league sub‑resources include:

- `settings` – league configuration:
  - Draft type and status.
  - Scoring type (e.g. `head` for head‑to‑head, `roto` for rotisserie).
  - Playoff configuration.
  - Roster positions.
  - Stat categories and stat modifiers.
  - Divisions.
- `standings` – standings and team outcome totals:
  - Overall rank and record (wins/losses/ties, percentage).
  - Divisional records.
  - Team points totals.
- `scoreboard` – weekly matchups and scores:
  - Week number.
  - For each matchup: teams, week, status, winner_team_key.
  - Weekly team points and projected points.
- `teams` – collection of teams in the league.
- `players` – league‑context players collection (with league filters and sorting).
- `transactions` – league‑scoped transactions collection.

Note: Live API responses may surface additional league-level elements or sub-resources that are not described in the official Yahoo Fantasy Sports API guide. Those fields are intentionally not documented or wrapped by this library until their behavior is explored and validated using real responses.

### Sample Responses

#### League metadata

Example: `GET /fantasy/v2/league/223.l.431` (simplified)

```xml
<fantasy_content>

## Leagues Collection

### Description

The **Leagues** collection lets you work with **multiple leagues at once**. This is usually scoped via:
- A games collection (e.g. games → leagues).
- A users collection (e.g. users → games → leagues).

Each element under `<leagues>` is a `<league>` resource.

### HTTP Operations

- Supported: `GET`

### URIs

Within the docs, league collections appear as nested sub‑resources. The patterns under `/fantasy/v2` are:

```text
/leagues/{sub_resource}
/leagues;league_keys={league_key1},{league_key2}/{sub_resource}
```

With full base URL:

```text
https://fantasysports.yahooapis.com/fantasy/v2/leagues;league_keys={league_key1},{league_key2}
https://fantasysports.yahooapis.com/fantasy/v2/leagues;league_keys={league_key1},{league_key2}/{sub_resource}
```

You can also append `out` to pull sub‑resources for each league:

```text
/leagues;league_keys={k1},{k2};out=settings,standings
```

### Sub-resources

Any sub‑resource valid for a **single `league`** is also valid under the **`leagues` collection**.

- Valid sub‑resources include at least:
  - `settings`
  - `standings`
  - `scoreboard`
  - `teams`
  - `players`
  - `transactions`

Examples:

- `GET /leagues;league_keys=223.l.431,223.l.999/settings`
- `GET /leagues;league_keys=223.l.431,223.l.999;out=standings`
- `GET /leagues/teams` (when nested under `games` or `users` chains)

The response will contain a `<leagues>` element with a `<league>` child element for each league key provided, each including the requested sub‑resources.
