## Game Resource

### Description

The **Game** resource describes a specific fantasy game (sport + season), such as:
- Fantasy Football (NFL)
- Fantasy Baseball (MLB)
- Fantasy Basketball (NBA)
- Fantasy Hockey (NHL)

It exposes metadata such as:
- Human‑readable name
- Game code
- Game ID
- Game type (full, pickem, etc.)
- Game URL
- Season year

### Game Keys

A game is identified by a **game key**, which can be either:
- `game_id` – numeric per season, e.g. `222`, `223`, `257`, etc.
- `game_code` – stable identifier for the game across seasons, e.g. `nfl`, `mlb`.

Key behavior:
- Using a `game_code` as the `game_key` returns the **current season** for that game.
  - Example: `game_key = nfl` during 2011 season is equivalent to numeric `game_id` `257`.
- The documentation includes a table of historical `game_id` values per sport and season.
- When you pass a `game_code` in the URI, the API converts it internally to a `game_id`. All keys in the XML response will use the numeric `game_id`.

Examples:
- Game code: `nfl`, `pnfl` (legacy plus/free distinction), `mlb`, `nhl`, etc.
- Game ID: `257` (NFL 2011), `253` (MLB 2011), etc.

### HTTP Operations

- Supported: `GET`

There are no documented `POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE` operations on the `game` resource in the public guide.

### URIs

Base format:

```text
https://fantasysports.yahooapis.com/fantasy/v2/game/{game_key}
```

Examples:
- `GET https://fantasysports.yahooapis.com/fantasy/v2/game/nfl`
- `GET https://fantasysports.yahooapis.com/fantasy/v2/game/257`

Sub‑resources are appended:

```text
https://fantasysports.yahooapis.com/fantasy/v2/game/{game_key}/{sub_resource}
```

Multiple sub‑resources using `out`:

```text
https://fantasysports.yahooapis.com/fantasy/v2/game/{game_key};out={sub_resource_1},{sub_resource_2}
```

### Sub-resources

The guide lists `metadata` as the **default sub‑resource**. Additional game‑level sub‑resources (summarized from the Yahoo docs) typically include:

- `metadata` – game meta info (default)
- `leagues` – leagues for this game
- `players` – players in this game
- `game_weeks` – schedule of weeks

Note: Live API responses may include additional game-level elements or sub-resources beyond those listed here. These do not appear in the official Yahoo Fantasy Sports API guide and are therefore not yet modeled as first-class concepts in this library. Any such fields should be explored and validated via real responses before being relied on or added to the SDK.

Supported sub‑resources can vary by sport and game type, but any sub‑resource valid at `game` level is also valid beneath the `games` collection.

### Sample Response

Example `GET /fantasy/v2/game/nfl` (simplified):

```xml
<fantasy_content>
  <game>
    <game_key>257</game_key>
    <game_id>257</game_id>
    <name>Football</name>
    <code>nfl</code>
    <type>full</type>
    <url>https://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/f1</url>
    <season>2011</season>
  </game>
</fantasy_content>
```

## Games Collection

### Description

The **Games** collection lets you work with **multiple game resources at once** and filter them by code, type, season, or availability.

Each element under `<games>` in the response is a `<game>` resource as described above.

### HTTP Operations

- Supported: `GET`

### URIs

The guide uses shorthand URIs under the `/fantasy/v2` root; when fully qualified, the patterns are:

```text
GET https://fantasysports.yahooapis.com/fantasy/v2/games/{sub_resource}
GET https://fantasysports.yahooapis.com/fantasy/v2/games;game_keys={game_key1},{game_key2}/{sub_resource}
```

You can also request games directly (no trailing sub‑resource) to only retrieve game metadata.

Examples:

- All games (optionally filtered):
  - `/fantasy/v2/games;game_codes=nfl,mlb;seasons=2011`
- Games plus sub‑resources:
  - `/fantasy/v2/games;is_available=1/metadata`
  - `/fantasy/v2/games;game_keys=nfl,mlb;out=leagues`

### Filters

The **games** collection supports several filters that can be combined:

| Filter       | Values / Meaning                                     | Example                                      |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `is_available` | `1` = only games currently in season                 | `/games;is_available=1`                      |
| `game_types` | `full`, `pickem-team`, `pickem-group`, `pickem-team-list` | `/games;game_types=full,pickem-team`         |
| `game_codes` | Any valid game codes                                 | `/games;game_codes=nfl,mlb`                 |
| `seasons`    | Any valid season years                               | `/games;seasons=2011,2012`                  |

Filters can be combined, e.g.:

```text
/games;seasons=2011;game_codes=nfl
```

### Sub-resources

In addition to the sub‑resources valid for a single `game` resource, the **games** collection supports collection‑level sub‑resources that are equivalent to resource‑level ones applied to each game:

- Any valid `game` sub‑resource is also valid under `games`.

Examples:

- `/games/leagues` – leagues for all games in the collection.
- `/games;game_keys=nfl,mlb/players` – players across NFL and MLB games.
- `/games;out=leagues,players` – attach both leagues and players as `out` expansions for the selected games.
